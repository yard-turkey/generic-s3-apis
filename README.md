## Generic Bucket Provisioning

Kubernetes natively supports dynamic provisioning for many types of file and
block storage, but lacks support for object bucket provisioning. 
This repo is a temporary placeholder for an object store bucket provisioning library,
very similar to the Kubernetes 
[sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner/blob/master/controller/controller.go)
library. The goal is to eventually move this repo to a Kubernetes repo within _sig-storage/_.

### Design
The time has come where we can support a bucket provisioning API similar to that used for
Persistent Volumes. We propose two new Custom Resources to abstract an object store bucket
and a claim/request for such a bucket.  It's important to keep in mind that this proposal 
only defines bucket and bucket claim APIs and related library code. The lib ensures that 
the _contract_ made to app developers regarding the artifacts of bucket creation (Secrets,
ConfigMaps) are guaranteed. The actual creation of buckets belongs to each object store
provisioner. However, as is true for dynamic Persistent Volume provisioning, each bucket
provisioner needs to adhere to the inferfaces defined in the bucket library.

An `ObjectBucketClaim` (OBC) is similar in usage to a Persistent Volume Claim
and an `ObjectBucket` (OB) is the Persistent Volume equivalent. 
Bucket binding refers to the actual bucket being created by the underlying object
store provide, and the generation of artifacts which will be consumed by application pods.
An OBC is namespaced and references a storage class which defines the object store. The
details of the object store (ceph, minio, cloud, on-prem) are not visible to the app pod
and can change without disturbing the app in anyway. An OB is non-namespaced (global),
typically not visible to end users, and will contain info pertinent to the provisioned
bucket. Like PVs, there is a 1:1 binding of an OBC to an OB.

As is true for dynamic PV provisioning, a bucket provisioner needs to be running
for each object store supported by the Kubernetes cluster. For example, if the
underlying object store is AWS S3, the developer will create an OBC, referencing
a Storage Class which references the S3 store. The cluster has the S3 provisioner
running which is watching for OBCs that it knows how to handle. Other OBCs are ignored
by the S3 provisioner. Additionally, the same cluster can have a rook-ceph RGW
provisioner running which also watches OBCs. Like the S3 proivisioner, it only handles
OBCs that it knows how to provision and skips the rest. In this proposal, the bucket
provisioners will be simple-to-write operators because the bucket provisioning lib
handles the bulk of the work. Each provisioner is only responsible for writing
`Provision()` and `Delete()`functions (the _business logic_) and a short `main()`
function. **Note:** even though the PV-PVC design supports static provisioning, only
dynamic provisioning is supported by the bucket lib.

The `Provision()` and `Delete()`functions are interfaces defined in the bucket library.
All bucket provisioners are required to return an OB struct and the bucket
credentials (access-key, endpoint) as defined in the bucket lib. Based on the returned
OB, the lib will create the bucket artifacts: user Secret, user ConfigMap, and OB
controller (primarily for status updates). The Secret and ConfigMap have deterministic
names, namespaces, and property keys. An app pod consuming a bucket need only be aware
of the Secret name and keys, and the ConfigMap name and fields. The app pod will not
run until the bucket has been provisioned and can be accessed. This is true even if
the pod is created prior to the OBC.

### Binding

Bucket binding requires these steps before the bucket is accessible to an app pod:
1. the creation of the physical bucket with the correct owner access key-pairs. This 
is done by each object store provisioner,
1. the creation of user access key-pairs, in the form of a Secret, granting the app
pod full access to this bucket (but not the ability to create new buckets). This is
done by the bucket library,
1. the creation of a ConfigMap which defines the endpoint of this bucket. Also done
by the bucket lib,
1. the creation of an OB watch/reconciler so that the actual-state-of-the-world is
refected in the OB. Done by the bucket lib.

`Bound` is one of the supported phases of an OB and OBC. `Bound` indicates that a
bucket and all related artifacts have been created on behalf of the OBC.

The credentials necessary to create a bucket need to be defined in an object
store specific Secret, which must be the only secret in the object store's
namespace. These credentials must grant CREATE access to the object store. The
bucket lib will generate a user-based Secret which grants all access except the
ability to CREATE buckets. The motivation here is to prevent an OBC author from
using the generated access key to create buckets outside of Kubernetes. 

### Bucket Deletion

An OBC can be deleted but the underlying bucket is not removed, in this POC phase, due
to concerns of deleting objects that cannot be easily recovered. However, OBC deletion
triggers cleanup of Kubernetes resources created on behalf of the bucket, including
the Secret and ConfigMap. Since the physical bucket is not deleted neither is the OB,
which represents this bucket. The OB's status will indicate that the related OBC
has been deleted so that an admin has better visibility into buckets that are missing
their connection information.

The generated OB's `ownerReference` is set to the object store, not to the OBC.
This allows an OBC to be deleted while preserving the OB. When the object store
service is deleted all OBs belonging to that object store will be automatically
deleted by Kubernetes due to the `ownerReference` setting.

**Note:** it is an expected enhancement to support a Storage Class' _reclaimPolicy_,
but for this POC phase, the safest approach is to ignore this policy and not delete
the bucket. Once _reclaimPolicy_ is supported an OB's `ownerReference` will need to
be set to the OBC if the the policy is to delete the bucket.

**Note:** the bucket library has no mechanism to prevent an OBC from being deleted when one or
more pods indirectly reference the OBC via the Secret and ConfigMap. This concept came late
for PVCs, see
[merged pr](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1174/files), and may be even more
difficult to implement for OBCs.

### Bucket Sharing

Env though there is a 1:1 mapping of an OBC and OB, a bucket can still be shared,
at least within the same namespace. The reason for this is because the app pods never
reference the OBC (or OB) directly, but instead consume a Secret and ConfigMap in
order to access the bucket. Since more than one pod can ingest the same Secert and
ConfigMap, a bucket can be shared. _TODO: verify._

### Quota

S3 bucket size cannot be specified; however, bucket size can be monitored in S3. The number
of buckets can be controlled by a resource quota once
[this k8s pr](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72384) is merged. Until then, 
Resource Quotas cannot yet be defined for CRDs and, thus, there is no quota on the 
number of buckets.
